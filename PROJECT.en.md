# Project structure

ftsg is meant to be a modular static site generator.
Written in Flask should be a base on which upon all different kinds of sites could be created.

ftsg in its simplest form should serve as a simple-in-use tech blog.

## Features for beta version
* Admin accounts which can create and remove normal user accounts. Admins can add/remove permission via simple tagging system.

* Creation, edition and removal of blog posts written in Markdown. Comment system (that allows for open and meritoric debate). Multilang support both for comments and for blogs.

## Modules ideas
* Simple programming tasks with auto-checking feature. Needs to provide simple way to add new languages.

* E-learning sessions (needs more thinking).
